Sure! Let's explain **mean** and **median** with simple math examples to make it easy to understand.

---

### **Mean (Average)**

The mean is the **average** of a set of numbers. You find it by **adding up all the numbers** and then **dividing by the count of the numbers**.

**Example:**

Let’s say we have these numbers:  
`2, 4, 6, 8, 10`

To find the mean:
1. **Add all the numbers together**:  
   \( 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30 \)
   
2. **Divide by the total count of numbers** (which is 5 here):  
   \( 30 \div 5 = 6 \)

So, the **mean** is **6**.

---

### **Median**

The median is the **middle value** in a list of numbers that’s been arranged in **ascending (or descending) order**. 

If the list has an **odd number of values**, the median is simply the middle number.  
If the list has an **even number of values**, the median is the **average of the two middle numbers**.

**Example with an odd number of values:**

Numbers:  
`1, 3, 5, 7, 9`

The middle value here is **5**, so the **median** is **5**.

**Example with an even number of values:**

Numbers:  
`1, 3, 7, 9`

Here, we have **4 values**, so we take the **two middle numbers**: `3` and `7`.  
Then, we find their average:  
\[
(3 + 7) \div 2 = 5
\]

So, the **median** is **5**.

---

### **Key Difference**:

- The **mean** is affected by every value in the list, so one very high or low number can change it a lot.
- The **median** only looks at the middle of the sorted list, so it's often used when you want to reduce the impact of extremely high or low values.


### **Standard Deviation**

The **standard deviation** is a measure of how spread out the numbers in a set are. It shows how much the numbers vary from the **mean** (average). A **low standard deviation** means the numbers are close to the mean, while a **high standard deviation** means the numbers are more spread out.

Here’s a step-by-step way to understand and calculate standard deviation with simple math.

### Steps to Calculate Standard Deviation

Suppose we have a small set of numbers:
\[ 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9 \]

1. **Find the Mean (Average)**:
   Add up all the numbers, then divide by the number of numbers:
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 9}{8} = \frac{40}{8} = 5
   \]

2. **Find the Difference of Each Number from the Mean**:
   Subtract the mean from each number to see how far each is from the mean:
   - \(2 - 5 = -3\)
   - \(4 - 5 = -1\)
   - \(4 - 5 = -1\)
   - \(4 - 5 = -1\)
   - \(5 - 5 = 0\)
   - \(5 - 5 = 0\)
   - \(7 - 5 = 2\)
   - \(9 - 5 = 4\)

3. **Square Each Difference**:
   Squaring removes negative signs and emphasizes larger differences:
   - \((-3)^2 = 9\)
   - \((-1)^2 = 1\)
   - \((-1)^2 = 1\)
   - \((-1)^2 = 1\)
   - \((0)^2 = 0\)
   - \((0)^2 = 0\)
   - \((2)^2 = 4\)
   - \((4)^2 = 16\)

4. **Calculate the Mean of the Squared Differences**:
   Add up all squared differences, then divide by the total count:
   \[
   \text{Variance} = \frac{9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 16}{8} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

5. **Take the Square Root of the Variance**:
   This gives the standard deviation:
   \[
   \text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{4} = 2
   \]

---

### Summary

For our set \([2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9]\):
- The **mean** is \(5\).
- The **standard deviation** is \(2\), indicating that on average, the values deviate from the mean by about \(2\).
