# Let's start by importing pandas below
import pandas as pd

# This challenge includes a billboard.csv dataset.
# It is a list of the top-selling albums of all time according to Billboard
# The dataset has 5 columns:
# Artist,Album,Released,Genre,Sales
# Import the billboard.csv fille into a DataFrame. 
# Assign the imported DataFrame to an 'billboard' variable.


# CHALLENGE 1
# Find all records with an Artist of either Michael Jackson,
# Whitney Houston, or Celine Dion. Assign the resulting 
# DataFrame to a "trios" DataFrame.


# CHALLENGE 2
# Find all records with Sales of either 25, 35, or 45
# million copies. Note that the 'Sales' column's integers
# reflect album sales in millions. Assign the resulting DataFrame
# to a 'fives' DataFrame
target_sales = billboard["Sales"].isin([25, 35, 45])
fives = billboard[target_sales]

# CHALLENGE 3
# Find all records released in either 1979, 1989, or 1999.
# Assign the resulting DataFrame to a 'end_of_decade' DataFrame.
