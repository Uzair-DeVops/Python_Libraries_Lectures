# This challenge includes a s&amp;p500.csv with 6 columns: 
# Symbol, Security, Sector, Industry, HQ, Founded
# Import the s&amp;p500.csv DataFrame and assign it to
# a companies variable.

# Sort the DataFrame by the values in the "Industry" column in ascending order
# Assign the new DataFrame to a "by_industry" variable.

# Sort the DataFrame by the values in the "HQ" column in descending order
# Assign the new DataFrame to a "by_headquarters_descending" variable.

# Sort the DataFrame by two conditions:
#  - by the values in the "Sector" column in descending order
#  - THEN by the values in the "Security" column in ascending order
# Assign the new DataFrame to a 'by_sector_and_security' variable
