# Let's start by importing pandas below
import pandas as pd

# This challenge includes a weather.csv dataset. It includes
# temperature measurements (high and low) for the month of April.
# The dataset has 3 columns:
# Day, Low Temp, High Temp
# Import the weather.csv file into a DataFrame. 
# Tell pandas to parse the values in the Day column as datetime values.
# Finally, assign the imported DataFrame to a 'weather' variable.


# CHALLENGE 1
# I want to see the temperature for the days between April 15, 2022 and April 22, 2022.
# Extract those rows to a new DataFrame and assign it to a 'week_of_weather' variable



# CHALLENGE 2
# Extract the rows where the value in the Low Temp column is between 30 and 50.
# Assign the new DataFrame to a "cold_days" variable.


# CHALLENGE 3
# Extract the rows where the value in the High Temp column is between 50 and 75.
# Assign the new DataFrame to a "warm_days" variable.
