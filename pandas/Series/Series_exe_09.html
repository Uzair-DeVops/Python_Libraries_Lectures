# We have a hot_dogs.csv CSV file with 2 columns: Year and Winner.
# The dataset stores the winner of the world-famous Nathan's Hot Dog Eating
# contest for each year since 1967. You can explore the data by clicking into 
# the CSV file on the left.
#
# Import the CSV file into a pandas Series object
# The Series should have the standard pandas numeric index
# The Series values should be the string values from the "Winner" column
# Assign the Series object to a "hot_dogs" variable


# I'm curious how many times each winner has won the hot dog-eating contest.
# Create a new Series that shows each person's name (index labels) 
# and the number of times they've won (the values). What method can
# help you generate this Series?
# Asssign the Series to a "names_and_wins" variable.
