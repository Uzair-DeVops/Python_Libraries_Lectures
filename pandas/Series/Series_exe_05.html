# We have a roller_coasters.csv CSV file with 4 columns: Name, Park, Country, and Height.
# You can explore the data by clicking into the CSV file on the left
# Import the CSV file into a pandas Series object
# The Series should have the standard pandas numeric index
# The Series values should be the string values from the "Name" column
# Assign the Series object to a "coasters" variable


# I only want to ride the top 3 roller coasters on the list.
# Starting with the "coasters" Series, extract the first 3 rows in a new Series.
# Assign the new Series to a "top_three" variable.


# I'm now curious about some of the last entries on the coaster list.
# Starting with the "coasters" Series, extract the last 4 rows in a new Series.
# Assign the new Series to a "bottom_four" variable.
